# Dumb Healer

**Dumb Healer** is a lightweight Python-based tool designed for gamers who need automated healing and mana management during gameplay. The tool allows you to monitor specific pixels on your screen, triggering key presses when health or mana levels change. It's fully customizable, with options to assign different keys for various actions and save/load profiles for different characters or situations.

## Features

- **Automated Healing**: Monitor health pixels and trigger a heal key when health drops.
- **Mana Management**: Monitor mana pixels and automate sitting/standing based on mana levels.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Save and load profiles for different characters or scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple tabbed interface for managing group members and the main character.
- **Dark Mode**: Sleek, modern dark theme using QDarkStyle.
